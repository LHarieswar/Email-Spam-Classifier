# Email-Spam-Classifier

### Goal of the project: 
Our goal is to develop a robust model capable of accurately predicting whether a given message is spam or not. We'll evaluate the models based on accuracy and precision metrics. Additionally, we'll test our model on real-world data to assess its performance.We'll employ various classifiers including SVC, MultinomialNB, DecisionTreeClassifier, LogisticRegression, RandomForestClassifier, AdaBoostClassifier, BaggingClassifier, ExtraTreesClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier, and XGBClassifier. to identify the spam emails
